# How Promises Work in JavaScript â€“ A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide

## Asynchronous:
JavaScript runs asynchronous instructions in the background until they have finished processing.


## Callback
A callback is any function that is a parameter of an async function, which the async function invokes to complete its operation.

pass a callback as an argument to the async function like this:

```
function callback(result) {
  // Use the result from the Async operation
}

randomAsyncOperation((response) => callback(response));
```


Assume you had an asynchronous function that fetched data somewhere on the internet. This function should accept two callbacks, successCallback and failureCallback.
```
function SuccessCallback(result) {
  console.log("Resource found", result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.error("Ooops. Something went wrong", error);
}

fetchResource(url, successCallback, failureCallback);
```

might run into this situation if the result of the next operation depends on the result of the previous one.
```
fetchResource( url,
  function (result) {  // successCallback
    // Do something with the result
    fetchResource(
      newUrl,
      function (result) {
        // Do something with the new result
        fetchResource(
          anotherUrl,
          function (result) {
            // Do something with the new result
          },
          failureCallback
        );
      },
      failureCallback
    );
  },
  failureCallback
);
```

## Promises
Promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future.

If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed. 

JavaScript promises can be in one of three possible states. These states indicate the progress of the promise:
- pending: This is the default state of a defined promise
- fulfilled:  This is the state of a successful promise
- rejected: This is the state of a failed promise
